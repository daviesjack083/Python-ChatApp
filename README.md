# Chat Application in Python
This is a real time chat application written in Python I'm developing alongside my C# version. It's very simple in it's current form but I'm hoping to build it up overtime. 

## To-do
- General refactor
- Create a shared library for the encryption
- Add rooms
- Add permissions
